### Script for Final Project for 575:

#### Premise: We are 2 different people, with 2 diff perspectives on watersheds and how we might use these based on our experiences. Together, we will take a cruise down the Mighty Mississip’ to learn about America’s watersheds and riverways.

Jack: Welcome to Geog575. I’m Jack Plasterer
Jess: And I’m Jessica Steslow. 
Jack: Today, we are going to take a cruise on the Mighty Mississippi and learn about watersheds here in the United States. Jessica, what should the user know about riverways and how and where water flows?
Jess goes into description of project [Looking at data from the hydroshed’s global db; from the Mississippi’s watershed. This area is defined as all the water that flows towards the Mississippi river. [maybe insert fact stating how many gallons of water flow thru the MS]
Jack: And YES – that’s a lot of water!
Jess: This shows the MS watershed with different basin levels, which show watersheds within watersheds.
Jack: So, you’re saying the water can get further divvyed up than just these large blobs? How far does this go?
Jess: Yes! These subdivided basins show how tributaries flow into the main branch. When we load the page, it’ll be basin level 5, this website shows basins subdivided to level 8. [Describe what each level means; it’s the shapefile name]. This is how hydrosheds label their subdivisions. Hydroshed subdivisions exist on a 1-12 scale. L1 is all land, and the data goes to level 8.
Jack: So, these smaller hydrosheds essentially bow before their queen that is the Mississippi river? [think MS queen riverboat]
Jess: Pretty much just that. 
Jack: What else should the average river boater know about this watershed the next time they’re floating on the Mississippi?
Jess…
Jack: Well Jess, this has been a very informative look at watersheds and basins. Thanks for rolling with us down the Mississippi and giving us an enhanced look at rivers!
Jess: My pleasure, happy to!
